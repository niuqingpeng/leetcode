Before presenting the algorithm, we review and analyze some examples to understand how the algorithm work. 
1) 2863|(7)---28673
2) 4|87(6)3---63487
3) 2|876(3)---32768

a) Start from the last postion i of array to find where the value decrease. 
'|' gives the postion where increasement stops from reverse order. 
0 1234
4|8763
We find position 0 where 4<8.
b) Reverse for postion i+1 to end. 
4|3678
c) binary search to find postion where value<4 and swap.
swap 4 and 3. 
34678
